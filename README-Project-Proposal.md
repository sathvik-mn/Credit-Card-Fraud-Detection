Overview:
The project aims to construct a Machine Learning model capable of identifying and flagging fraudulent transactions in real-time. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle (Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset (kaggle.com)). Utilising advanced machine learning algorithms, the system will be analysing transaction patterns and user behaviour to accurately differentiate between legitimate and suspicious activities. This initiative seeks to enhance security measures for financial institutions and protect consumers from potential financial losses due to fraud.


Task T:
The task (T) of the model will be to identify and flag fraudulent transactions on credit cards in real-time. The task can be classified under supervised learning as the goal is to classify transactions into 2 categories: Fraudulent & Non Fraudulent.


Experience E:
Working with a simulated credit card transaction dataset which was generated using Sparkov tool by Brandon Harris. The dataset includes two files (fraudTrain & fraudTest) with a diverse range of transaction scenarios across different profiles of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants, from the duration 01/01/2019 to 12/31/2020 enhancing the model's ability to generalise across various conditions.
Data dimension
Number of Samples: 
Train data: 1048575
Test data: 555719
Number of Features: 23
Dataset size: 
Train data: 334 MB
Test data: 143 MB


Performance P:
The performance (P) of the model will be measured based on its ability to accurately identify fraudulent transactions. Given the unbalanced nature of the dataset, accuracy alone may not be the best metric. Instead, we will focus on metrics such as Precision, Recall, and the F1 Score to assess the model's success.


Motive to address T:
	Fraudulent transactions on credit cards can lead to significant financial losses for both consumers and financial institutions, as well as damaging trust and security in financial systems. By developing a machine learning model capable of detecting such fraud in real-time, we can significantly reduce the incidence of fraud, protect consumers' financial assets, and enhance the overall security of financial transactions. Addressing this task is highly valuable as it makes financial environments safer, reduces money lost to fraud, and boosts people's trust in online payments.
